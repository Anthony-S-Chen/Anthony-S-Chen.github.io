Anthony Siming Chen was born and raised in Taiyuan, China, where he completed his secondary education at Taiyuan No. 5 Middle School. He later received his B.Eng. degree in Transportation Engineering in 2015 from [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/), where he was a member of Shenghua Honors College under a National Talent Program and graduated with the highest honors. During his undergraduate studies, he completed a one-year industrial placement at [CRRC](https://www.crrcgc.cc/en/) in China. After relocating to the United Kingdom, he obtained his M.Sc. degree in Advanced Mechanical Engineering in 2016 with the top overall grade in the cohort, and his Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2022 from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). His doctoral research was conducted within the Dynamics and Control Research Group (DCRG). He has held research and visiting positions at the Control Systems and Robotics Group (CSR) and the Centre for Robotics and AI at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), and the Institute for Advanced Automotive Propulsion Systems (IAAPS) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/).

He is currently an Assistant Professor in Aerospace Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Nottingham. He holds secondary appointments in the Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Manufacturing Engineering (M3) and the School of Computer Science. He is a member of the [Mechanical and Aerospace Systems Research Group (MAS)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mas/index.aspx), [Rolls-Royce UTC in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/utc-transmissionsys/index.aspx), and the [Institute for Aerospace Technology (IAT)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/aerospace/). He also currently holds an honorary research position with CSR at the University of Manchester. 

Dr. Chen is a RAICo Fellow, Member of IEEE (MIEEE), Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (MIET), Member of the Royal Aeronautical Society (MRAeS), and Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA). He is actively involved in the [IEEE Control Systems Society (CSS)](https://www.ieeecss.org/) and the [IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS)](https://www.ieee-ras.org/). He serves on the IEEE Technical Committee on Quantum Computing, Systems and Control, the IEEE Technical Committee on Robot Learning, the IEEE Technical Committee on Robotic Hands, Grasping and Manipulation, and the IEEE Technical Committee on Robot Control. He is an Associate Editor of *Aerospace Science and Technology* and *Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Control Systems*. He regularly publishes in and reviews for leading journals and conferences in control and robotics, including *IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control*, *Automatica*, *IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology*, *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*, *IEEE Transactions on Robotics*, *IEEE Control Systems Letters*, *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters*, *ICRA*, *IROS*, and *CDC*. He received the *Best Student Paper* Award at the 9th IEEE International Conference on Modeling, Identification, and Control (2017) for his work on adaptive control of spark-ignition engines. His research lies at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and robotics, with a particular emphasis on embodied intelligence and safe learning-based control for complex real-world systems. His work spans applications in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aero-engines, robotic manipulators, soft robotic hands, and quantum systems.
