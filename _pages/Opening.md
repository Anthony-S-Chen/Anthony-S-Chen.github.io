## Research Vision

My research aims to advance **embodied intelligence**: intelligence that emerges from the tight coupling between learning, control, and physical interaction with the real world.

In particular, I am curious about:

- In-situ learning: Enabling robots to learn directly on hardware during real-world operation.
- Adaptive optimal control: Merging optimality, stability, and robust uncertainty management. 
- Efficient reinforcement learning: Achieving high performance with minimal data and computation, while prioritizing safety.

<h2 align="center">“What is outside the simulation?”</h2> 

The ultimate aim is to deepen our understanding of intelligence, philosophy, and even theology. Elon Musk once said, “One of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask. Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy.” By exploring human consciousness and humanity’s drive to reach the stars and space, we can build autonomous systems that are truly intelligent, safe, secure, and reliable. In Elon’s words, “I came to the conclusion that we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask. Really, the only thing that makes sense is to strive for greater collective enlightenment.”  This pursuit ties into why we venture into space: to preserve and expand the light of consciousness beyond Earth, and why we develop AI: to augment human potential and ensure biological intelligence evolves alongside digital advancements.  

Drawing from Elon’s simulation hypothesis, where he argues there’s a “one in billions” chance we’re in base reality, AI could play a pivotal role in probing deeper existential questions. He has suggested that the first question to ask a superintelligent AI would be: “What’s outside the simulation?”  If we are indeed in a simulation, what’s outside? Musk speculates that base reality might be “boring,” as simulations distill the most interesting aspects of existence.  Through my research, we aim to develop AI systems capable of tackling such profound inquiries, bridging philosophy, consciousness, and advanced technology to uncover the nature of our reality.
