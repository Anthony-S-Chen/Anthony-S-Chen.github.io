## Research Vision

My research aims to advance **embodied intelligence**—intelligence that emerges from the tight coupling between learning, control, and physical interaction with the real world.

In particular, I focus on:

- **In-situ learning**, where systems learn directly on hardware during operation  
- **Adaptive optimal control**, integrating performance, stability, and uncertainty handling  
- **Efficient reinforcement learning**, enabling data-efficient and safe learning in physical systems  

The long-term goal is to develop autonomous systems that are not only intelligent, but also **safe, reliable, interpretable, and deployable in safety-critical environments**, including aerospace, robotics, energy, and future quantum technologies.
