<p>
I am an Assistant Professor in Aerospace Control at the University of Nottingham,
working at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and robotics.
My research tackles the design of intelligent, safe, and reliable systems that
bridge rigorous mathematical principles with real-world engineering challenges
in aerospace, autonomous systems, and complex robotic platforms.

the use and convenience of mankind.” – <em>Thomas Tredgold</em>

<h3>What I Do</h3>
<p>
My work aims to develop theory and methodology for learning-enabled control systems
that are verifiable, robust, and applicable to real hardware. I build principled
frameworks for embodied intelligence that unify adaptive learning, optimal control,
and safety guarantees. My applications span:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unmanned aerial and ground vehicles</li>
  <li>Aero engines and propulsion systems</li>
  <li>Robotic manipulation including soft-rigid end-effectors</li>
  <li>Quantum systems and high-dimensional dynamics</li>
</ul>

<div class="opening-section">
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>
I believe in *theory with impact*: deep mathematical insights grounded in
practical engineering problems. My research pairs rigorous analysis with
simulation and real experiments. I actively collaborate with interdisciplinary
teams in academia and industry to push the frontier in autonomous decision
systems, safe adaptive control, and intelligent robotics.

<h3>Get Involved</h3>
<p>
If you are a student, researcher, or practitioner interested in control,
robotics, or learning-enabled systems, feel free to explore my publications,
projects, and teaching pages. I am always looking to connect with curious
minds and collaborators.
