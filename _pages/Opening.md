## Open Positions

I lead research on **embodied intelligence, in-situ learning, adaptive optimal control, and efficient reinforcement learning** at the intersection of control theory, robotics, and aerospace systems. My group develops learning-enabled control methods that are safe, data-efficient, and deployable on real physical platforms such as UAVs, robotic manipulators, and soft robotic systems.

I am always interested in hearing from **outstanding and highly motivated prospective PhD students and postdoctoral researchers** who wish to work in these areas at the University of Nottingham.

If you are interested, please feel free to contact me directly by email with your CV and a brief statement of research interests.

## Research Vision (Brief)

My research aims to advance **embodied intelligence**: intelligence that emerges from tight coupling between learning, control, and physical interaction with the real world. In particular, I am interested in:

- **In-situ learning**: robots that learn directly on hardware during operation  
- **Adaptive optimal control**: combining optimality, stability, and uncertainty handling  
- **Efficient reinforcement learning**: minimizing data and computation while maintaining safety and performance  

The long-term goal is to build autonomous systems that are truly intelligent, and also *safe and secure, reliable, interpretable, and deployable in safety-critical environments*.
