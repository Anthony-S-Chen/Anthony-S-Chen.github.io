I am an Assistant Professor in Aerospace Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Nottingham. I hold secondary appointments in the Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Manufacturing Engineering (M3) and the School of Computer Science. I am a Member of the [Mechanical and Aerospace Systems Research Group (MAS)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mas/index.aspx), [Rolls-Royce UTC in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/utc-transmissionsys/index.aspx), and the [Institute for Aerospace Technology (IAT)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/aerospace/). I also hold an honorary research position with CSR at the University of Manchester. 

### Research

My research interests include Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning, Embodied Intelligence, and Quantum Control. I work at the intersection of theory and application, with a strong focus on developing learning-based control methods to solve complex real-world engineering challenges, as well as advancing control methodologies for scientific exploration. My research covers a broad spectrum of applications, including propulsion systems, robotics, and quantum systems.

I have led and contributed to a variety of research projects in intelligent control and robotics, focusing on the development and implementation of advanced control frameworks across multiple domains:
- Control: Adaptive optimal control [TAC2025], [CDC2023], [CDC2019], [IJACSP2025].
- Robotics: [T-RO2025], [RA-L2025], [TMECH2024], [IROS2024].
- Automotive and Aerospace systems: (Reinforcement)-Learning-based control [TCST2024][IFAC2023], Estimation (Observer) design [TVT2017][AST2024][TCST2019], Adaptive control [ICMIC2017], Dynamics modeling [SAE2020],[IFAC2017].
- Quantum systems: [L-CSS2024].
