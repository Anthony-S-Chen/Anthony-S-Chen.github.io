I am an Assistant Professor in Aerospace Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/). I hold secondary appointments in the Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Manufacturing Engineering (M3) and the School of Computer Science. I am a Member of the [Mechanical and Aerospace Systems Research Group (MAS)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mas/index.aspx), [Rolls-Royce UTC in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/utc-transmissionsys/index.aspx), and the [Institute for Aerospace Technology (IAT)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/aerospace/). I also hold an honorary research position at the Control Systems and Robotics Group (CSR) and the Centre for Robotics and AI at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

### Research

My research lies at the intersection of **control theory**, **machine learning**, and **robotics**, with a particular emphasis on **embodied intelligence** and safe learning-based control for complex real-world systems. My work spans a broad spectrum of applications in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), propulsion systems, aero-engines, robot manipulators, soft/rigid robotic hands, and quantum systems.

#I have led and contributed to a variety of research projects in intelligent control and reinforcement learning, focusing on the development and implementation of advanced control frameworks across multiple domains:
- Control: Adaptive optimal control [TAC2026], [CDC2023], [CDC2019], [IJACSP2025].
- Aerospace systems: (Reinforcement)-Learning-based control [TCST2025][IFAC2023], Estimation (Observer) design [TVT2017][AST2024][TCST2019], Adaptive control [ICMIC2017], Dynamics modeling [SAE2020],[IFAC2017].
- Robotics: [TMECH2024], [IROS2024], [CDC2025].
- Quantum systems: [L-CSS2024].
