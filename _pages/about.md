I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/), U.K. I am affiliated with the Mechanical and Aerospace Systems Research Group [(MAS)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mas/index.aspx) and serve as an associate member of both the Power Electronics, Machines, and Control Research Institute [(PEMC)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/pemc/home.aspx) and the Aerospace Technology Institute [(ATI)](https://www.ati.org.uk/). I hold an honorary academic position with the [Control Systems and Robotics Group (CSR)](https://uom-csrgroup.uk/) and the [Centre for Robotics and AI](https://www.robotics.manchester.ac.uk/), the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), Manchester, UK. 

At Nottingham, I contribute to teaching across the BEng/MEng Aerospace Engineering programmes, delivered jointly by the Departments of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering (M3) and Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), teaching modules such as MMME2058 Aerospace Control and MMME3077 Avionics.


### Biography

I received my B.Eng. (2015) in Transportation Engineering at [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/) as a member of Shenghua Honors College under a 
National Talent Program. During my undergraduate studies, I spent one-year industrial placement at [CRRC](https://www.crrcgc.cc/en/) in China. In 2015, I moved to the UK and obtained an M.Sc. (2017) in Advanced Mechanical Engineering and a Ph.D. (2022) in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), where I conducted research within the Dynamics and Control Research Group [(DCRG)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/dynamicscontrol/). I have held research and visiting positions with [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), the Institute for Advanced Automotive Propulsion Systems [(IAAPS)](https://iaaps.co.uk/) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/).

I am an IEEE Member of the Control Systems Society [(CSS)](https://www.ieeecss.org/) and the Robotics and Automation Society [(RAS)](https://www.ieee-ras.org/). I am a member of the IEEE CSS Technical Committee of Quantum Computing, Systems and Control, IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Robot Learning, IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Robotic Hands. I regularly review for leading journals and conferences in Control and Robotics, including IEEE TAC, Automatica, IEEE TCST, IEEE CDC, IEEE L-CSS, IEEE RA-L, IEEE T-RO, IROS, and ICRA.

### Research

My research interests include Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning, Embodied Intelligence, and Quantum Control. I work at the intersection of theory and application, with a strong focus on developing learning-based control methods to solve complex real-world engineering challenges, as well as advancing control methodologies for scientific exploration. My research covers a broad spectrum of applications, including propulsion systems, robotics, and quantum systems.
