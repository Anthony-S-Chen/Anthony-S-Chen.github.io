I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Control Systems and Robotics Group [(CSR)](https://uom-csrgroup.uk/), the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), Manchester, UK. I have a B.Eng. (2015) in Transportation Engineering from [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in China. After moving to England in 2015, I obtained an M.Sc. (2017) in Advanced Mechanical Engineering and a Ph.D. (2022) in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). I was a Visiting Researcher with the Institute for Advanced Automotive Propulsion Systems [(IAAPS)](https://iaaps.co.uk/) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/) from 2016 to 2022.

### Research

My research interests focus on intelligent control and robotics. 

I have a deep interest in control theory: 
- Adaptive optimal control:[TAC2024], [CDC2023], [CDC2019]

and I am committed to advancing the field by integrating fundamental control principles with innovative technologies for real-world applications:
- Robotics: [RA-L2024], [TMECH2024], [IROS2024]
- Automotive systems: [TCST2024],[TII2024],[IFAC2023],[SAE2020],[UKACC2018],[TCST2019],[TVT2017],[ICMIC2017],[IFAC2017]
- Quantum theory: [L-CSS2024]

I am committed to advancing the field by integrating fundamental control principles with innovative technologies to solve complex problems and drive technological progress.
