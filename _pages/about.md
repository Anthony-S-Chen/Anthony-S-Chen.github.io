I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Control Systems and Robotics Group [(CSR)](https://uom-csrgroup.uk/), the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), Manchester, UK. I have a B.Eng. (2015) in Transportation Engineering from [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in China. After moving to England in 2015, I obtained an M.Sc. (2017) in Advanced Mechanical Engineering and a Ph.D. (2022) in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). I was a Visiting Researcher with the Institute for Advanced Automotive Propulsion Systems [(IAAPS)](https://iaaps.co.uk/) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/) from 2016 to 2022.

My research interests are centered around control theory and its extensive applications in robotics, automotive systems, and quantum theory. I am committed to advancing the field by integrating fundamental control principles with innovative technologies to solve complex problems and drive technological progress.
