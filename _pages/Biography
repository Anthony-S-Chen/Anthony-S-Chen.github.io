Anthony Siming Chen was born in Taiyuan, China. He earned his B.Eng. in Transportation Engineering (2015) at [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/) as a member of Shenghua Honors College under a 
National Talent Program. During his undergraduate studies, he spent a one-year industrial placement at [CRRC](https://www.crrcgc.cc/en/) in China. After relocating to the United Kingdom, he obtained his M.Sc. in Advanced Mechanical Engineering (2016) and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (2022) from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), where he conducted research within the [Dynamics and Control Research Group (DCRG)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/dynamicscontrol/). I have held research and visiting positions with [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), the [Institute for Advanced Automotive Propulsion Systems (IAAPS)](https://iaaps.co.uk/) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/).

He currently serves as an Assistant Professor in Aerospace Engineering, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Nottingham. He holds secondary appointments in the Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Manufacturing Engineering (M3) and the School of Computer Science. He also holds an honorary position with the Control Systems and Robotics Group (CSR) and the Centre for Robotics and AI at the University of Manchester, U.K.. He was a Visiting Researcher with the Institute for Advanced Automotive Propulsion Systems (IAAPS) at the University of Bath from 2016 to 2022.is

Dr. Chen is an IEEE Member of the [Control Systems Society (CSS)](https://www.ieeecss.org/) and the [Robotics and Automation Society (RAS)](https://www.ieee-ras.org/). He is a member of the IEEE CSS Technical Committee of Quantum Computing, Systems and Control, IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Robot Learning, IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Robotic Hands. he regularly review for leading journals and conferences in Control and Robotics, including IEEE TAC, Automatica, IEEE TCST, IEEE CDC, IEEE L-CSS, IEEE RA-L, IEEE T-RO, IROS, and ICRA. He has received numerous prestigious awards, including the \textit{Best Student Paper} Award at the 9th IEEE International Conference on Modeling, Identification, and Control in 2017 for his work on adaptive control for SI engines. His research sits at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and robotics, with a particular focus on embodied intelligence and learning-based methods for complex real-world systems. His work spans applications in UAVs, aero-engines, robot manipulators, soft robotic hands, and quantum systems.
