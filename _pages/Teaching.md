I am an Assistant Professor in Aerospace Control in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Nottingham. My teaching focuses on aerospace control systems, avionics, and applied control engineering, with an emphasis on connecting theory to real-world aerospace and robotic systems.

## EEEE3128 – Avionic Systems (Module Convenor)

**Level:** Year 3 Undergraduate  
**Credits:** 20  

This module covers the principles, architectures, and technologies underlying modern aircraft avionics systems. It combines theoretical foundations with practical system-level understanding.

**Main topics include:**
- Basic concepts, history, and avionics architecture (LRUs, federated vs IMA, civil vs military avionics)
- Radar I: pulse radar and positioning basics
- Radar II: CW and FMCW radar systems
- Flight control systems (fly-by-wire, autopilot, FMS, redundancy)
- Avionics systems engineering (Industry Guest Lecture by Leonardo UK)
- Navigation systems (GNSS, INS, and aircraft sensors)
- Military avionics and mission systems
- Human–machine interface and cockpit display systems
- Avionics communication systems and cybersecurity
- Advanced and emerging topics in avionics (e.g., spacecraft avionics, autonomy, eVTOL, UAV swarms) 

As module convenor, I design the curriculum, assessments, coursework projects, and continuously update the content to reflect current industrial practice.

## MMME2058 – Aircraft Dynamics and Control (Control Part)

**Level:** Year 2 Undergraduate  
**Credits:** 20 (year-long core module)  

This module provides students with the fundamentals of flight dynamics and control systems for aircraft. I am responsible for the **control systems component** of the module.

**Flight Dynamics topics:**
- Introduction to flight dynamics
- Longitudinal flight dynamics
- Longitudinal flight modes
- Lateral–directional flight dynamics
- Lateral–directional flight modes
- Roll and Dutch roll modes
- Dutch roll and spiral modes
- Review of flight dynamics

**Control Systems topics:**
- Introduction to control systems
- System modelling and transfer function representation
- Feedback control systems analysis
- PID Control
- Crandfield Flight Test - Field Trip
- Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion
- Control system simplification & design workflow
- Aerospace control applications
- Modern control and advanced topics

The module emphasizes building physical intuition for feedback control, stability, and performance, supported by worked examples and aerospace case studies.

## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach emphasizes:

- **Conceptual understanding before formalism** – ensuring students grasp physical meaning before mathematical abstraction.  
- **Application-driven learning** – connecting control theory to real aerospace and robotic systems.  
- **Structured progression** – from fundamentals to advanced topics.  
- **Active engagement** – through problem-solving sessions, practical examples, and discussion.  

I aim to equip students with both rigorous theoretical foundations and the ability to apply control engineering principles in real engineering contexts.
