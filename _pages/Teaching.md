## EEEE3128 – Avionic Systems (Module Convenor)

**Level:** Year 3 Undergraduate  
**Credits:** 20  

This module covers the principles, architectures, and technologies underlying modern aircraft avionics systems. It combines theoretical foundations with practical system-level understanding.

**Main topics include:**
- Introduction to Avionics Systems 
- Radar System I: pulse radar and positioning basics
- Radar System II: CW and FMCW radar systems
- Flight control systems
- Avionics Industry Talk (Guest Lecture by Leonardo UK)
- Navigation systems
- Military avionics and mission systems
- Human–machine interface and cockpit systems
- Avionics communication systems and cybersecurity
- Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Advanced Topics

As module convenor, I design the curriculum, assessments, coursework projects, and continuously update the content to reflect current industrial practice.

## MMME2058 – Aerospace Dynamics and Control (Control Part)

**Level:** Year 2 Undergraduate  
**Credits:** 20 (year-long core module)  

This module provides students with the fundamentals of flight dynamics and control systems for aircraft. I am responsible for the **control systems component** of the module.

**Flight Dynamics topics:**
- Introduction to flight dynamics
- Longitudinal flight dynamics
- Longitudinal flight modes
- Lateral–directional flight dynamics
- Lateral–directional flight modes
- Roll and Dutch roll modes
- Dutch roll and spiral modes
- Review of flight dynamics

**Control Systems topics:**
- Introduction to control systems
- System modelling and transfer function representation
- Feedback control systems analysis
- PID Control
- Crandfield Flight Test - Field Trip
- Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion
- Control system simplification & design workflow
- Aerospace control applications
- Modern control and advanced topics

The module emphasizes building physical intuition for feedback control, stability, and performance, supported by worked examples and aerospace case studies.

## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach emphasizes:

- **Conceptual understanding before formalism** – ensuring students grasp physical meaning before mathematical abstraction.  
- **Application-driven learning** – connecting control theory to real aerospace and robotic systems.  
- **Structured progression** – from fundamentals to advanced topics.  
- **Active engagement** – through problem-solving sessions, practical examples, and discussion.  

I aim to equip students with both rigorous theoretical foundations and the ability to apply control engineering principles in real engineering contexts.
