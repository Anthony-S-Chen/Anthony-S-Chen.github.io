I am an Assistant Professor in Aerospace Control in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Nottingham. My teaching focuses on aerospace control systems, avionics, and applied control engineering, with an emphasis on connecting theory to real-world aerospace and robotic systems.

## EEEE3128 – Avionic Systems (Module Convenor)

**Level:** Year 3 Undergraduate  
**Credits:** 20  

This module introduces the principles, architectures, and technologies underlying modern aircraft avionics systems. It combines theoretical foundations with practical system-level understanding.

**Main topics include:**
- History and evolution of avionics systems  
- Aircraft sensors and instrumentation  
- Radar systems and navigation (VOR, DME, GPS, INS)  
- Flight management systems and fly-by-wire  
- Aircraft displays and human–machine interfaces  
- Avionics data buses and system integration  
- Electronic warfare and military avionics  
- Case studies of real-world civil and military aircraft systems  

As module convenor, I design the curriculum, assessments, coursework projects, and continuously update the content to reflect current industrial practice.

## MMME2058 – Aircraft Dynamics and Control (Control Part)

**Level:** Year 2 Undergraduate  
**Credits:** 20 (year-long core module)  

This module introduces students to the fundamentals of flight dynamics and control systems for aircraft. I am responsible for the **control systems component** of the module.

**Topics covered in my part include:**
- Introduction to aerospace control systems  
- Open-loop vs closed-loop control  
- System modelling concepts for control  
- Time-domain and frequency-domain analysis  
- PID controller design for flight dynamics  
- Lead–lag compensator design  
- Introduction to modern control methods and aerospace applications  

The module emphasizes building physical intuition for feedback control, stability, and performance, supported by worked examples and aerospace case studies.

## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach emphasizes:

- **Conceptual understanding before formalism** – ensuring students grasp physical meaning before mathematical abstraction.  
- **Application-driven learning** – connecting control theory to real aerospace and robotic systems.  
- **Structured progression** – from fundamentals to advanced topics.  
- **Active engagement** – through problem-solving sessions, practical examples, and discussion.  

I aim to equip students with both rigorous theoretical foundations and the ability to apply control engineering principles in real engineering contexts.
